Fixed a bug in the s3repository 
RepositoryProtectedEntityTypeManager.GetProtectedEntitiesByIDPrefix that was
not handling pagination in results properly.  This call would loop if there were
more than 1000 results matching the prefix.  Fixed to use the NextContinuationToken
instead of ContinuationToken for the where to start the next loop
